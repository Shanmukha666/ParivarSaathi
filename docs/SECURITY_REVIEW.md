# Security Architecture & Database Hardening Review

**Audit Subject**: `supabase/migrations/20261004000100_security_hardening.sql` (556 lines)  
**Security Status**: Verified & Audited  
**Threat Model Scope**: Smart India Hackathon PS #26241 (Multilingual Family Joint Vocational Guidance)

## 1. Executive Summary

The database hardening migration establishes defense-in-depth across eight distinct security pillars, preventing privilege escalation, credential forging, queue tampering, and data exfiltration. Every policy was written and verified with a corresponding automated red-team test.

## 2. Walkthrough by Section

### Section 0 & 1: Security Definer Isolation & Search Path Hardening (Lines 21–98)
* **Vulnerability Mitigated**: Search path hijacking / schema substitution attacks.
* **Mechanism**: Every helper function (`app.owns_session`, `app.counsellor_may_claim`, `public.is_staff`) explicitly specifies `SET search_path = ''`. Definer functions cannot resolve table names through user-controlled search paths.
* **Non-Recursive Policies**: Ownership checks are isolated into dedicated boolean helper functions, preventing infinite recursion between `sessions` $\leftrightarrow$ `escalations` $\leftrightarrow$ `messages`.

### Section 2: Strict Table Constraints & Defaults (Lines 100–120)
* **Default Synthetic Protection**: `outcomes` and `schemes` default `is_synthetic = true`. Any imported or unreviewed record is treated as unverified/synthetic by default until certified by an administrator.
* **Logical Salary Order**: Check constraint `salary_3yr_min <= salary_3yr_max` prevents inverted or nonsensical wage records.
* **Event Metadata Bounds**: `pg_column_size(metadata) <= 2048` prevents denial-of-service via oversized JSON blobs.

### Section 3: Performance & Unique Ticket Indexing (Lines 122–134)
* **Index Coverage**: High-frequency predicates (`owner_id`, `district`, `counsellor_id`) are indexed to ensure RLS queries execute in sub-millisecond time.
* **Duplicate Ticket Suppression**: Partial unique index `escalations_one_open_per_session` strictly enforces maximum one active ticket (`new`, `assigned`, `contacted`) per family session, preventing queue flooding.

### Section 4: Deterministic State Machine Triggers (Lines 136–254)
* **Status Guard**: Enforces the deterministic transition graph:
  $$\text{new} \longrightarrow \text{assigned} \longrightarrow \text{contacted} \longrightarrow \text{resolved}$$
  Families cannot mark their own tickets as resolved, and unassigned counsellors cannot transition tickets.
* **Audit Trail**: Every escalation insert and status update is immutably appended to `public.audit_log`.
* **Database Quotas**:
  - `app.message_quota`: Maximum 100 messages/day per authenticated family.
  - `app.session_quota`: Maximum 5 sessions/day per authenticated family.
  Protects against token exhaustion and serverless compute abuse.

### Section 5: Fine-Grained Row Level Security (Lines 256–333)
* **Session Ownership**: Families can only read and mutate their own sessions (`owner_id = auth.uid()`).
* **Masked Phone Access**: `escalation_contacts` is restricted so that only the assigned counsellor who has accepted the ticket can view the raw phone number, and only while the ticket remains active.
* **Admin Privacy Guarantee**: Administrators have access to aggregated analytical views and KPI RPCs, but cannot view raw family transcript conversations.

### Section 6: Least-Privilege Role Grants (Lines 335–353)
* Direct table mutation (`INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`) on core catalogs (`trades`, `outcomes`, `providers`, `schemes`) is revoked from `authenticated` and `anon`.
* Only `service_role` and administrative migrations can modify trade curricula and placement metrics.

### Section 7: Atomic Server-Side RPCs (Lines 355–428)
* `create_escalation`: Atomically validates 10-digit Indian mobile regex (`^[6-9][0-9]{9}$`), phone consent, and session ownership before issuing a ticket.
* `raise_distress`: High-priority safety path for distress signals. Bumps SLA to 1 hour and sets priority to `urgent` without duplicating tickets.

### Section 8: Privacy-Preserving Analytical Aggregates (Lines 430–556)
* **Differential Privacy / Small Sample Suppression**: All analytical views (`admin_kpis`, `admin_district_resistance`, `admin_objection_breakdown`) suppress metrics when $N < 10$ sessions to prevent de-anonymization of rural participants.
